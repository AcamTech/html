#StydeNet Html package

This package contains a collection of Laravel PHP classes designed to generate common HTML components, like:

* Menus
* Alert messages
* Form fields
* Collection of radios and checkboxes

This is an extension of the Laravel Collective HTML package and will be very useful for you if you are working in a custom CSM, an admin panel or basically any project that needs to generate dynamic HTML.

###I'm currently working on the documentation

However, you can find a lot of docblock comments if you dig into the source course, as well of unit tests in the spec directory.
